What is Ops Manager?

### What?
Ops Manager is a web application that you use to streamline deploying and managing Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployments.

Ops Manager can deploy many different Pivotal software products such as Cloud Foundry, Gemfire, and Kubernetes as well as partner products like Jenkins. These products are represented as Tiles in Ops Manager.
A Tile is a zip file with a `.pivotal` extension containing:
- one or more BOSH release tarballs containing the product's source code and dependencies
- a metadata file used to generate a BOSH manifest and Ops Manager form elements for that product
- migrations files to automatically handle property changes when upgrading to a newer Tile

The Ops Manager Dashboard looks like the following:

![Ops Manager Dashboard](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/images/interface.png)

The Ops Manager shown here has three Tiles installed:
- The BOSH Director tile on the left comes pre-installed with your Ops Manager. Ops Manager will deploy a BOSH Director on your chosen IaaS to manage your deployments.
- The Pivotal Application Service (PAS) in the middle is the Cloud Foundry deployment. This is roughly equivalent to the Cloud Foundry you deployed in earlier stories with cf-deployment.
- The MySQL tile on the right deploys a MySQL Database for your CF apps.

More information about the Dashboard UI can be found [here](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/pcf-interface.html#installation-dashboard).
Additional Tiles can be downloaded from [PivNet](https://network.pivotal.io) and uploaded into your Ops Manager.

Clicking on the "BOSH Director for GCP" tile, it looks like the following:

![Tile UI](https://github.com/pivotal/cf-onboarding/raw/opsman-pas/images/director-tile.png)
TODO: change branch opsman-pas back to master

Tiles provide multiple configuration panes that let you input or select configuration values needed for the product.

For example, "Google Config", "Director Config", and "Create Available Zones" are all forms to select your Director and IaaS configuration.
After saving these forms and clicking Apply Changes on the Dashboard, Ops Manager will deploy a BOSH Director using the provided values.

All other Tiles will be deployed as a separate BOSH deployment using that Director.
For example, filling out the forms on the PAS Tile will generate a BOSH manifest and clicking Apply Changes will then deploy that manifest using the BOSH Director.

After clicking Apply Changes, Ops Manager will run `bosh upload-release`, `bosh deploy`, and other BOSH commands you've run in previous stories and stream the output to the UI.

In addition to the UI, Ops Manager provides an [API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/opsman-api/) to allow users to configure Tiles via scripts.
The UI provides a nice onboarding experience, but we still encourage customers to setup Concourse pipelines to automatically configure their tiles.
This ensures configuration is checked into source control and reproducible in case something goes wrong.
The [om CLI](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om) can be used to programmatically perform operations in Ops Manager.

PCF refers to your entire IT platform, not just the Cloud Foundry deployment.
A company might require some apps to run on CF and others on Kubernetes.
These apps might need Databases, logging, and other services to be deployed as well.
Ops Manager provides a single Dashboard to manage this wide array of components.

Differences between PCF and cf-deployment

### CF vs PCF

In the stories earlier in onboarding week, you used `bbl up` to create some GCP infrastructure and BOSH + cf-deployment to deploy a Cloud Foundry.
Tools covered those stories are all open-source

CF Foundation

Ecosystem

Customers of each

### Technical Similarities and Differences

Similarities:
- Both use BOSH to deploy software
- Many products can be deployed with either OSS tooling or Ops Manager
- The App Developer CLI experience such as `cf push` is the same, although PCF adds web apps like Apps Manage to streamline this experience
- We would encourage both PCF and OSS users to configure their environments with a Concourse pipeline

Differences:
- Ops Manager uses forms to configure each product while cf-deployment uses a list of ops-files
- Ops Manager Tiles include migrations to automatically handle changes like BOSH property renames when upgrading to newer versions
  - cf-deployment users would need to carefully read release notes to handle any manifest changes
- Ops Manager provides input verifiers to perform input validation prior to deploying, such as ensuring DNS records exist or Database credentials are valid
- PCF provides long-term support (LTS)
  - Many Pivotal customers have complicated change management processes which require new features to be carefully vetted before deploying to production
  - These customers often stay on older versions of PCF products for many months after newer versions have been released
  - LTS means that Pivotal will backport security fixes to previously released versions of PCF products, while new features are only added to the latest release
  - cf-deployment users will need to upgrade to the latest release in order to get these security fixes
- Ops Manager provides a consistent experience to install many different products
  - While lots of work has gone into making deploying CF with cf-deployment a nice experience, the quality of documentation on other BOSH releases is highly variable
- Ops Manager attempts to abstract away the BOSH implementation details, although you will still interact with BOSH when debugging
  - This added layer of abstraction can make debugging more difficult
- Clicking Apply Changes in Ops Manager is typically slower than running `bosh deploy`
  - Ops Manager performs many safety checks to ensure everything is in a good state, but this takes additional time
- Tile authors often only expose a subset of BOSH properties via the UI
  - A smaller set of properties to configure makes it easier to get something working initially, but can prevent you from configuring more advanced features
- Ops Manager does not allow you to change the deployment topology (which jobs are located on which VMs)
  - In cf-deployment you can add an ops-file to co-locate a new job on an existing VM, Ops Manager requires the Tile author to make changes to their Tile to allow this
  - Some Tiles like PAS provide both a full HA version and a "Small Footprint" version to co-locate jobs on a smaller number of VMs

### Ops Manager Interface
[Understand how an Operator uses Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/customizing/pcf-interface.html)

## Deploying on GCP
While we use BOSH to deploy a director and many of our services, Ops Manager is currently not deployed with BOSH.

The first step to installing Ops Manager is to set up your infrastructure.
There are some terraform scripts that will do this for you that you can download from Pivotal Network.
Go to [network.pivotal.io](https://network.pivotal.io) and make sure you're signed in to PivNet (if you don't have an account yet, click "Register" to create one.).
Next, search for `Pivotal Application Service`. Once you open the product, you should see GCP Terraform templates in "Release Download Files".

Unzip the file to get the terraform templates. You can take a look at the README to see how the whole repo works, but the important bit is in the section titled "Var File". Use those instructions to build a var file for terraform. **Take care to notice some of the following gotcha's.**
1. The `project` variable needs to equal the ID of your GCP project. That's not the same thing as the _name_ of your GCP project. To find the ID, click on the project dropdown to the left of the search bar. You should say a table mapping project names to project IDs.
2. The `opsman_image_url` bears some explanation. As it's name implies, it's a URL to an OpsMan image. In the GCP case specifically, that means tha the OpsManager team has already uploaded an image in a global GCP bucket, so all you need to do is point your terraform templates at the right image. To construct the URL, you'll first need to know that all buckets have a URL of the form `https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucket name>/<file name>`. To find the bucket and file name, you'll want to find the "Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager" product on PivNet, and then download "Ops Manager for GCP". Surprise! What you actually got was a PDF that includes the bucket and file name. Note that there are different buckets for different regions -- pick the one that makes the most sense. You can test your url by running `curl --head URL` -- if you get a 200, you're in good shape.
3. `sevice_account_key` needs to contain your GCP credentials. You'll actually paste the contents of the service account key file (probably called `service-account.key.json` if you've already done the OSS GCP onboarding epic) into the var file. Make sure to keep the `<<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` and `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` tokens, as those designate the beginning and end of the creds.
4. `dns_suffix` is like the `system_domain` from the OSS GCP track -- it should be some subdomain of `onboarding.cf-app.com` and is used to represent your particular environment.
5. For SSL configuration, let's use self-signed certificates. That means you'll set values for `ssl_cert` and `ssl_private_key`. To generate SSL keys, run `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -nodes`. When you generate the certificates, make sure that the "Common Name" field matches your `dns_suffix`.
6. Leave `buckets_location`, `opsman_storage_bucket_count`, `create_iam_service_account_members` blank.

Finially, you'll run
```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform will not only pave your IaaS for you -- it will also deploy the OpsMan VM for you. However, before you can use the provided domain to access OpsMan, you need to do one last manual DNS hookup:
1. In the "Cloud DNS" tab in the GCP console, click on the zone that matches your full OpsMan domain.
2. You should see an `NS` record with four domains in the `Data` field. Copy them.
3. Go back to the "Cloud DNS" and navigate to the zone that matches your DNS suffix (it should look like `<env-name>.<project-name>.cf-app.com`).
4. Add a record set. It should be an `NS` record, you'll need to add each of the four domains you copied as a new name server.
5. Test that it works by running `nslookup pcf.<env_name>.<dns_suffix>`. If it returns an IP address, you've successfully set up DNS.

Congrats! You've got OpsManager up and running.

Before you can use it, you need to configure authentication. Your best bet is to use "Internal Authentication." Create a user with whichever useername, password, and decryption passphrase you want (you can leave the http proxy information blank).

### Expected Results
OpsManager is running and you can log in.

Deploy BOSH Director using Ops Manager

Configure the BOSH GCP tile using this [guide](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/om/gcp/config-manual.html). Some tips to keep you from getting stuck:
1. When you get to "Create Availability Zones", you'll want to use the same AZs that you specified in your terraform.
2. Make sure to read in the instructions carefully when you configure the networks. Especially be careful when setting the network names: they have the form `<network-name>/<subnet-name>/<region>`

After you've configured the BOSH Director tile (it should be green to indicate that you're finished configuring the tile), you can visit the **Review Pending Changes** page and click **Apply Changes**. You'll see the same logs as if you used `bbl` or the `bosh` CLI.
Once the deployment is done, you can visit `/change_log` to review the logs of past deployment.

After the deploy succeeds, click around and see if you can information about the BOSH Director's health. Can you the BOSH Director IP address? How much memory/disk/CPU it's using?

### Expected Results
OpsMan successfully deploys a BOSH Director.

Deploy some tiles

## What?
OpsManager uses "tiles" to deploy different products. You can find tiles by searching on [PivNet](https://network.pivotal.io). Then you can download them, upload them to your OpsManager, and finally configure and deploy them.

Some tiles have dependencies on other tiles. You should find information about that in the product description on PivNet.

To understand the workflow of an actual PCF/OpsMan customer, choose a tile or two to install and follow the appropriate docs.

## How?
Let's start by installing the mother of them all: PAS. Go to PivNet, search for "Pivotal Application Service", and download the "Small Footprint PAS" -- we'll use this to save some time during the deploy. Your best bet is to choose the latest stable version (avoid releases with `alpha` or `rc` in it).

And yes, the file is rather large (as of this writing, it's 13 GB), so feel free to take a ping pong break while it's downloading.

Use the official docs as guide to configure and deploy PAS. You can the docs for PAS 2.3 [here](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/gcp-er-config.html), but if you're using a new version than that, you can use the dropdown next to "Pivotal Cloud Foundry" to find docs for the appropriate version.

## Expected Result
You've got a running PAS.
